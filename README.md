# Bushwick-Film-Festival
From March to November of 2021, I worked for the Bushwick Film Festival, researching information on various film festivals taking place around the world. The data obtained through this research was inputted into a central database created utilizing Google Sheets. The central database created is found under the file name "BFF Film Festival Database.pdf".
